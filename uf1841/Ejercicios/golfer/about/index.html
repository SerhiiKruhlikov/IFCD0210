			</h1>
			<p>
				Where I’m from<br> I was born and raised in the southeast suburbs of Victoria, Australia — a place
				almost perfecting the ‘<a href="#link">surbubia as giant nursery</a>’ vision of urban development.

				Currently, I help build <a href="#link">modal.com</a>, a serverless cloud platform built for developers
				and data scientists sick of wrestling Kubernetes. Scroll down to see some personal dashboard stats

				Where I’m at now
			</h2>
			<p>
				Today, I live in NYC. When I’m not working, you can find me walking a new part of the five boroughs, or
				stopped in a park to read. There’s a lot to love in this vast, grubby city, and I hope to see all of it
				by foot.
			</p>
			<h2>
				What I used to do
			</h2>
			<p>
				I spent 3.5 years at <a href="#link">Canva</a>, joining when it had almost 300 engineers and leaving
				when it had about 1,800. I joined as a graduate, hobbling around with a broken leg, and ended up as team
				lead of ML Platform. The whole way through I grew under the mentorship of <a href="#link">Greg Roodt</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				When not doing Data or ML Platform stuff, I spent quite a bit of time working with the <a href="#link">Bazel</a>
				build system, and helped maintain the <a href="#link">Python rules</a> for Bazel. It’s the future, get
				on it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Previous to Canva I worked at <a href="#link">Zendesk</a> on their <a href="#link">Answer Bot</a>
				machine learning product, and at <a href="#link">Atlassian</a> as an application developer intern in
				their reliability/monitoring team.
